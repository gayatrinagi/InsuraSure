# 🛡 InsuraSure

**Predict. Protect. Prepare.**

InsuraSure is a machine learning–powered web application that predicts health insurance premiums based on lifestyle and health metrics.

***

## 📖 Overview

Health insurance costs are often complex and opaque. InsuraSure makes them more transparent by using a trained ML model to estimate premiums from inputs such as age, BMI, smoking status, children, and region.

It also highlights why a given premium was predicted (using SHAP explainability) and flags unusual input profiles with an anomaly detector.

***

## ✨ Features

- 🔮 **Premium Prediction** → Instant estimates using a trained Random Forest model.  
- 💡 **Explainability (SHAP)** → Shows top 3 factors that increase/decrease your premium.  
- 🚨 **Fraud/Anomaly Detection** → Flags suspicious or unrealistic input patterns.  
- ⚖ **BMI Calculator** → Compute BMI and categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).  
- 🖥 **Responsive UI** → Built with MaterializeCSS + Jinja2 templates.  
- 📊 **Baseline Comparison** → Shows model’s expected premium vs. your personalized adjustments.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

1. **Random Forest Regressor (Premium Prediction)**  
   - Features: Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region  
   - Target: charges (insurance premiums)  
   - Tuned with GridSearchCV (n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split)  
   - Saved as `rf_tuned.pkl`  

2. **Isolation Forest (Fraud/Anomaly Detection)**  
   - Detects unusual profiles in insurance data  
   - Contamination ≈ 0.05 (5% anomalies assumed)  
   - Saved as `fraud_iforest.pkl`  

3. **SHAP (Explainability)**  
   - Provides per-prediction attributions for each feature  
   - Example:  
     - ↑ Smoking: +₹12,000  
     - ↑ BMI: +₹5,000  
     - ↓ Younger age: −₹1,500
